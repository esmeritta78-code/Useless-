# Invisible Maze ‚Äî Gloriously Pointless üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Green Bytes 2.0


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abhinav K M - MA College

### Project Description
A visually stunning yet entirely pointless browser game where you try to navigate an invisible maze you can‚Äôt see.
Random glitches, fake walls, and unexpected control reversals keep you from ever ‚Äúwinning‚Äù ‚Äî but at least the background is hypnotic.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern games make too much sense. They have maps, objectives, and achievable goals. This is unacceptable for chaos lovers.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We deleted the map, removed the purpose, and banned the win condition. Then we sprinkled in random chaos events, fake encouragement,
and a mesmerizing blue particle background so you can be confused and entertained at the same time.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (Vanilla)




# Installation
No installation ‚Äî just open the HTML file in your browser.

# Run

Get confused.

Accept the chaos.
