Invisible Maze — Gloriously Pointless 🎯
Basic Details
Team Name: Green Bytes 2.0

Project Description
A game where you navigate an invisible maze you can’t see… while random glitches, lies, and particle art compete for your attention. It’s pretty. It’s useless. It’s art.

The Problem 
Gamers today suffer from too much clarity in game design. They can see the map, understand the objectives, and actually finish things. Where’s the chaos? The mystery? The pointless wandering?

The Solution 
We removed the map, the purpose, and the victory condition. Then, we sprinkled in random glitches, fake walls, control reversals, and a hypnotic blue particle background — because if you’re going to be lost, at least be lost in style.

Technical Details
Technologies Used
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Libraries: None (pure chaotic vanilla JS)

Tools: A keyboard, a brain that said “what if?”

Implementation
Run
Open index.html in your browser.

Stare at the pretty blue strings.

Move your player with arrow keys.

Realize movement is pointless.

Question your life choices.

Particles that do more work than the game itself.


A random glitch. You don’t know why it happened, and neither do we.
